- **Help Command**: Lists all available commands.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArqTras/networkbot.git
cd networkbot

```

### 3. Install dependencies

### 5. Add your bot tokens

- Create a file named `token.info` for your Telegram bot token and `discord_token.info` for your Discord bot token.
  
  - For Telegram, create a file `token.info` in the root folder:

    ```txt
    <Your Telegram Bot Token>
    ```

  - For Discord, create a file `discord_token.info` in the root folder:

    ```txt
    <Your Discord Bot Token>
